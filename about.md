### Me

Hi, I'm Konstantinos Kirtsonis.

I'm also <em>really</em> Cooking, reading, friends and hiking.

### What I know

As a result of my perpetual curiosity, I have practical experience with a wide range of technologies including:

R • Python • Statistics • Visualization • Tableau • Microsoft Office • Machine Learning • Data Analysis • Data Mining • SQL • JAVA

for use with concepts such as:

Machine Learning Algorithms, Data Analytics, Statistical Data Analysis, Natural Language Processing, Data Visualization, Database Systems & Information Modelling • Software Engineering • Web Application Development, <em>and more!</em>

Thankfully, I'm not a cat.

### Certificates I've completed:
