description: This is a project created in order to define the conflicts between an existing 3D Tunnel model and a new 3D updated model at the same position. The Dynamo flow enhanced with the Python programming language, can change automatically the path file in order to align to the 3D Tunnel Model geometry in order to minimize the conflicts.

This is a project created in order to define the conflicts between an existing 3D Tunnel model and a new 3D updated model at the same position. The Dynamo flow enhanced with the Python programming language, can change automatically the path file in order to align to the 3D Tunnel Model geometry in order to minimize the conflicts. 

Afterwards the script creates an Excel file with all the intersection and non-intersection points and the measurements of the distances of the top Level of the two tunnels. Also a PowerBI dashboard is created combining the 3D Model along with the data analysis from Dynamo
